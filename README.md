# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
## About this project and Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Program
This project aims to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
The coding environment is Python(Pandas, Numpy). The data is contained in 'countries.csv'.
## How to run this project
You can download the ipynb to run it with Jupyter Notebook(don't forget to download csv sheet as well) or view as a HTML.
